# am4bot v2-v3

A combination of the v2 rewrite (Dec 20 - Apr 21) / v3 rewrite (Mar 22, modern python rewrite intended to quickly replace `src-old` but didn't have time).

Both versions are completely abandoned and will be deleted later!

The `notes` directory and `star.py` was used for star alliance research purposes and route planning.

## V2

first iteration is `c/helper_c.c`, then eventually rewrote it in `helper_cy.pyx`

## V3
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ cp .env.template .env
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 main_v3.py
```

Edit `.env` accordingly.
